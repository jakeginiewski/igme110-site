                <p>This image was the result of a project that had me design a magazine cover. The person on the cover is a face generated by the AI on <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>. I initially named him Gil Bates due to his similarity in appearance to a certain billionairre, but after a few jokes and critiques from my group his name was revised to Tim. The 'Tim' on his forehead is supposed to be a tatoo, though I don't think it looks all that great.</p>
