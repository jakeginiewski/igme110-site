                <p>This research paper was written on the topic of interactive media; more specifically, it was written on the effect social media has on American culture and society. It was very interesting for me to go back through all of the ways this technology has changed the way we communicate since its inception. I particularly enjoyed sifting through information concerning major breaches of user privacy, as that is a topic I find to be extremely important and exciting.</p>
